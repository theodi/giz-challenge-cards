"World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews - Synthetic Data Governance Frameworks",https://journalwjarr.com/sites/default/files/fulltext_pdf/WJARR-2025-2046.pdf,"Comprehensive framework with Synthetic Data Governance Checklist (SDGC) and Synthetic Integrity Index (SII) covering five dimensions: provenance transparency, distributional fidelity, privacy assurance, fairness preservation, and deployment context evaluation. Validation across 64 organizations shows 73.8% fewer regulatory incidents with proper governance."
"Qualtrics - Synthetic Data Validation: Methods & Best Practices",https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/synthetic-data-validation/,"Practical guide on validation methods including statistical similarity tests, bias audits, privacy assessments, and subject matter expert review. Emphasizes that synthetic data without validation risks costly mistakes and that fairness, transparency, and accountability must be embedded in validation processes."
"World Economic Forum - AI and the Growth of Synthetic Data",https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/ai-synthetic-data-strong-governance/,"Explains that synthetic data requires robust provenance systems, data traceability, and watermarking to enable accountability and reduce risks like bias amplification. Highlights that success depends on bridging developers, end users, executives, lawyers, and policy advisors in governance roles."
"Medium - Data Governance for Synthetic Data",https://medium.com/@fahey_james/data-governance-for-synthetic-data-7f37845e2e03,"Outlines critical governance requirements including audit trails documenting which real datasets contributed to generation, bias detection pipelines, differential privacy safeguards, and dataset expiration policies. Emphasizes that synthetic data is not a shortcut but a regulated asset requiring standards."
"Open Data Institute (ODI) - Towards the Ethical Use of Synthetic Data in Health Research",https://theodi.org/insights/reports/towards-the-ethical-use-of-synthetic-data-in-health-research/,"ODI research examining technical and ethical limitations of synthetic data in health research contexts. Takes ethics-based approach to determine optimal responsible use practices, addressing current attitudes and efforts towards using synthetic data where sensitive patient data is valuable but subject to greater protections. Identifies opportunities for broader use through additional guidance and policy."
"PMC (National Library of Medicine) - Synthetic Data in Medicine: Legal and Ethical Considerations",https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12166703/,"Analyses GDPR implications showing that while fully synthetic data may not constitute personal data, its downstream application in decision-making can raise fairness, bias, and accountability concerns. Advocates for real-time bias monitoring, third-party auditing, and transparency throughout synthetic data lifecycle."
"Bipartisan Policy Center - Synthetic Data: Use Cases and Tradeoffs",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/synthetic-data/,"Explains fully synthetic vs. partially synthetic data categories and their tradeoffs. Highlights U.S. Census Bureau experience showing that small inaccuracies in synthetic data may reduce researchers' abilities to establish causal links, and that data external to synthesis process are not validated for realism."
