"Data-Smart City Solutions (Harvard Kennedy School) - From Concept to Practice: Digital Twins to City Twins",https://datasmart.hks.harvard.edu/concept-practice-digital-twins-city-twins,"Comprehensive overview of digital twin applications in urban planning, covering high-resolution 3D modelling, scenario planning, shading analysis, and policy research. Discusses limitations and highlights that digital twins are still in infancy, with divergent opinions on modelling urban processes versus representing physical environments."
"Eurocities - Local Digital Twins Empower Urban Planners for Informed Decisions",https://eurocities.eu/latest/local-digital-twins-empower-urban-planners-for-informed-decisions/,"Explains digital twins as virtual sandboxes where planners can simulate hypothetical interventions and explore potential outcomes. Emphasises importance of integrating citizen perspectives through participatory processes and the need for evidence-based, transparent decision-making with traceability."
"American Planning Association - Smart City Digital Twins Are a New Tool for Scenario Planning",https://www.planning.org/planning/2021/spring/smart-city-digital-twins-are-a-new-tool-for-scenario-planning/,"Addresses the shift from isolated simulations to integrated citywide modelling that accounts for policy decisions in one area impacting other areas. Discusses applications in public engagement, scenario planning, and zoning, with predictions that 500+ city digital twins will be deployed globally by 2025."
"Legitimacy of Algorithmic Decision-Making: Six Threats and the Need for a Calibrated Institutional Response",https://academic.oup.com/ppmg/article/5/3/232/6555119,"Comprehensive framework identifying six threats to legitimacy of algorithmic government across input, throughput, and output dimensions. Addresses clarification of responsibilities, human rights impact assessments, and preventing democratically unchecked rule of experts in algorithmic decision-making."
"Governing Algorithmic Decisions: The Role of Decision Importance and Governance on Perceived Legitimacy",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20539517221100449,"Evidence-based research on how type of decision (high vs. low importance) and governance mechanisms impact perceived legitimacy of algorithmic decisions. Finds that human-in-the-loop governance increases legitimacy perceptions, with important implications for balancing efficiency with democratic accountability."
"Philosophy & Technology - Algorithmic Accountability and Public Reason",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-017-0263-5,"Philosophical framework situating algorithmic accountability within democratic ideal of "public reason"—the requirement that decisions be justifiable by commonly accepted principles. Addresses tension between need for universal rules and reasonable disagreement about values underlying those rules."
"ResearchGate - Algorithmic Governance and the Redefinition of Bureaucratic Accountability in Digital States",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392527119_Algorithmic_Governance_and_the_Redefinition_of_Bureaucratic_Accountability_in_Digital_States,"Mixed-methods research on how algorithmic governance disrupts traditional chains of responsibility through distributed accountability across developers, data providers, vendors, and automated agents. Proposes hybrid accountability framework incorporating explainability, contestability, and human-in-the-loop controls."
"AI & Society - Artificial Intelligence, Transparency, and Public Decision-Making",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-020-00960-w,"Examines role of transparency in how public perceives AI decision-making as legitimate and worthy of acceptance. Addresses different types of transparency (process vs. outcome) and argues transparency alone insufficient—must be combined with mechanisms promoting legitimacy and democratic acceptance."
"Government Information Quarterly - Do Citizens Trust Trustworthy AI? Experimental Evidence on Limits of Ethical AI Measures",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0740624X23000345,"Survey experiments showing that short-term communication about ethical AI measures (legal compliance, human-in-the-loop, non-discrimination) have little to no effect on citizen trust. Prior attitudes and experiences form better predictors, suggesting need for long-term comprehensive approaches addressing underlying concerns."
"Human-AI Interactions in Public Sector Decision Making: 'Automation Bias' and 'Selective Adherence'",https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/33/1/153/6524536,"Three-study examination of automation bias in public sector contexts, finding that decision-makers don't automatically defer to algorithms but engage in "selective adherence"—more likely to follow algorithmic advice when aligned with pre-existing stereotypes. Important evidence on how biases operate in human-algorithm collaboration for policy decisions."
